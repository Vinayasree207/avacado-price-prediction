Prediction of price of Avocado in US Region - Regression

### Introduction

Your client for this project is a major Avocado Producer.

- Their avocados are sourced from over 1000 growers owning over 65,000 acres across California, Mexico, Chile, and Peru.
- With generations of experience growing, packing, and shipping avocados, they have a deep understanding of the avocado industry.
- Their aim is to source quality fruit thatâ€™s sustainably grown and handled in the most efficient, shortest supply route possible.
- They want to increase their supply throughout the United States and need to make sure that they are selling their products at the best possible price.

Current Scenario

- Avocado prices have rocketed in recent years by up to 129%, with the average national price in the US of a single Hass avocado reaching $2.10 in 2019, almost doubling in just one year.
- Due to this uncertainty in the prices, the company is not able to sell their produce at the optimal price.

### Problem Statement

The current process suffers from the following problems:

- The price of avocado is dependent on global demands and seasonal production.
- Due to these reasons, it is quite difficult to know for certain the price in the future.

##### Your Role
- You are given a dataset containing the weekly retail scan data of avocadoes.
- Your task is to build a regression model using the dataset.
- You need to build the best possible model.

##### Project Deliverables
- Deliverable: Predict the average price of a single avocado.
- Machine Learning Task: Regression
- Target Variable: AveragePrice
- Win Condition: N/A (best possible model)

##### Evaluation Metric
- The model evaluation will be based on the RMSE score.
